The zero-knowledge (zk-SNARK) is a user level for understanding - the math is deep and I don't know of a good paper to read that will
give a understanding of the math in it.

Consider z-Cash and Ripple.  Ripple is using a Honey Badger based consensus system.  z-Cash is using zero-knowledge proofs.
Both of these are 3rd generation systems.

There are a number of projects around the state government and UW that are Blockchain related.

1. Environmental Credits
1. Co2 Sequestration Credits
1. Supply Chain Tracking (SheepChain)
1. Document Tracking
1. Registration of Companies

Pick one of these and write an outline of how it can be implemented on a Blockchain.
