# Lecture 05 - How death is created (Blockchain, AI/Classification)

Most of you came to university to create a career - basically to make money.
So let's talk about money!

Let's talk about averages for UW graduates.

Average for staring with a bachelors in Computer Science is $79,900.00,
UW is a little above averse, $82,000.00.

Average student loans, US average is $41,000.00.  UW is much better at
$22,800.00.

So...  You start out ahead for the very beginning!  That's always good.

Now if you follow the "banks" financing plan for student loans you
will pay off the loan in about 25 years and pay roughly 3x the value
of the loan - so you will pay about 46,000 in interest - total is 
a $68k .   Back before the pandemic I used to go to the bank - we won't
say which one I use but both of the banks that I use have a basket
with loly-pops on the counter.  They fill it up for the customers
with "Dum-Dum"s - I have always wanted to ask if that is a comment
on the customers!

So ... Let's talk about Rich.   

Rich graduated from UW with a Masters in Computer Science at the
same time as I did.    So... Roughly spiking we started at the
same point.  He worked for 32 years for the same company and
just this year took "retirement" from the copay.

His career path is a perfect example of saying "between the lines".

Here is how a "job" works.

You get hired.  For about 5 to 7 years you get raises.
After that you get cost of living - that is because a job is
really only worth what is worth.  SO after about 5 to 7 years
you get payed what the job is worth - not what you are worth.

You can move to a better job that pays more.  After 15 years
Rich got a MBA and moved into a management position and
raised how much he made.

So on average a UW Computer Science will start at  $82k and
over about 6 years that will grow to $102,200 - right at the
national average.

So ... 102k is good!  This is not a job at McDonalds.  I worked
at McDonalds.  I have tremendous respect for McDonalds.

Now if you do what Rich did - You get a good car, get married,
have some kids, a good house in the burbs.  You finance the
car for you and one for your wife, ... But at the end you
basically spend all you make.  Rich married a RN - that is
like a masters in nursing.  2 good paying jobs.

Don't get things wrong - I have worked and I think getting a good
education is important and a good job is a wonderful thing.

I think that a job - if you use it wrong really stands for
Journey Of the Broke.   At the end of 32 years of work
Rich had saved approx. $400,000.00 for retirement.
Between the two of them they were making over $200k a year.

His employer has a defined benefits retirement plan.  Hers
had a 401k.  So... They  are over 62 - old engorge to get
Social Security.

They have make somewhere north of 4 million - and at the end
all they have to show for it is - a payed off house, $625k,
$400k savings and social security and a retirement check
of $1420 a month.

SO... not broke but not really wealthy - notice that 
house + retirement makes Rich and wife millionaires!  But if
you pull out all of your death from a house - you sell it -
you now need a new house - most people want someplace to live.
Millionaire and living on the street as a bum is not most people's 
plan in life.

If you have no "financial plan" you are likely to end up where you plan to end up.
Nowhere.
