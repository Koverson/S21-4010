Homework 7 - Due April 26

## Hmoework 7 (200pts)

1. Install truffle and sold - get the contract to compile.
2. Make the changes in `SignedDataVersion01.sol` to save and return data.
3. Run some tests with it.

You will probably need to create a directory to install and setup truffle.   An example of this is the
./eth directory.  It has a `truffle.js` and other stuff - so you can make a copy of it and it's 
sub directories.   The 2 contacts will need to go into your `./eth/contracts` and there is
a makefile that has the commands to compile the code.

This is mostly about working through the Ethereum/solidity/truffle install process and
getting a simple contract to compile and load.
