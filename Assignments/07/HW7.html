<h1>Homework 7 - Due April 26</h1>

<h2>Hmoework 7 (200pts)</h2>

<ol>
<li>Install truffle and sold - get the contract to compile.</li>
<li>Make the changes in <code>SignedDataVersion01.sol</code> to save and return data.</li>
<li>Run some tests with it.</li>
</ol>

<p>You will probably need to create a directory to install and setup truffle.   An example of this is the
./eth directory.  It has a <code>truffle.js</code> and other stuff - so you can make a copy of it and it&rsquo;s
sub directories.   The 2 contacts will need to go into your <code>./eth/contracts</code> and there is
a makefile that has the commands to compile the code.</p>

<p>This is mostly about working through the Ethereum/solidity/truffle install process and
getting a simple contract to compile and load.</p>
